    <p>
        A unique identifier for the checker.
    </p>
    <p>
        UUIDs are of the form SCHEME ':' ID. The scheme and ID portions may only contain
        alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) plus the punctuation characters ., _, and -.
        Thus UUIDs are URL-safe without escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scheme is by convention a short string (max 100 chars) associated with the
        external system that created the checker, for example jenkins. The scheme must also
        be a valid ref name component according to git-check-ref-format, for example it may
        not start or end with a period.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ID is an arbitrary identifier that may have meaning to the external system.
    </p>
    <p>
        UUIDs must be unique and are immutable after creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Checker names cannot be used as identifiers in the REST API since checker names
        may be ambiguous.
    </p>
