# Gerrit Code Review plugin for Jenkins

[![Jenkins Plugin Installs](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/plugin/i/gerrit-code-review.svg?color=blue)](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-code-review)

This plugin allows any Jenkins multi-branch pipeline to be seamlessly
integrated with [Gerrit Code Review](https://gerritcodereview.com) for branches and changes validation.

## Why yet another plugin?

I wanted to use the Gerrit CI validation workflow with potentially any
project, including Gerrit plugins or anybody else wanting to adopt it.
I could just "copy & paste" our Groovy workflow, however, that does not
seem a sensible and long-term approach.
I wanted to have "something more" than a pure triggering mechanism: I
wanted to extend the power of Jenkisfile with the Gerrit review workflow
verbs.

## What about the Gerrit Trigger Plugin?

The **new plugin is not going to replace the current Gerrit Trigger
Plugin**, but would rather represent an alternative to simpler scenarios
when you just require a standard Jenkinsfile Gerrit validation workflow.
For all the current users of the Gerrit Trigger Plugin things wouldn't
change, unless they need a more Jenkisfile-integrated experience.

## Why not?

Why should I write yet another Gerrit/Jenkins plugin? Isn't Gerrit
Trigger Plugin
(<https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger>) enough?
We couldn't use it against
[gerrit-review.googlesource.com](http://gerrit-review.googlesource.com)
because stream events are just not accessible.

There are unresolved issues about:

-   **Stability**
    stream-events are based on SSH, which isn't scalable or reliable
    against downtime, doesn't allow smart Git routing
-   **Complex configuration**
    requires a node-level and project-level configuration, which is
    orthogonal to the Jenkinsfile pipeline
-   **Integration**
    using it inside a Jenkinsfile isn't that straightforward and
    multi-branch projects aren't supported either

## Why a new name?

The new name "Gerrit Code Review Plugin" indicates Gerrit as the
first-class citizen of the Jenkins ecosystem, and not just as an "extra
triggering or validation" logic of a Jenkins job.

**Jenkinsfile / Scripted pipeline example,** with Gerrit Code Review
integration:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
node {
  checkout scm
  try {
    stage('Hello') {
      echo 'Hello World'
    }
    gerritReview score:1
  } catch (e) {
    gerritReview score:-1
    throw e
  }
}
```

**Jenkinsfile / Declarative pipeline example**, with Gerrit Code Review
integration:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        success { gerritReview score:1 }
        failure { gerritReview score:-1 }
    }
}
```

One key aspect will be: stateless, configuration-less apart the standard
SCM configuration settings.
That means that multiple Jobs, multiple branches of the same Job, can
have their own Gerrit integration defined and working out-of-the-box.

No more people asking "how do I configure the Gerrit integration"? it
will just work.

# Plugin Releases

I have presented the first prototype of this new plugin at the Jenkins
World Conference in San Francisco back in 2017 inside my "Data-Driven
Pipeline workshop."
(<https://jenkinsworld20162017.sched.com/event/APTd/data-driven-pipeline-workshop-free>)

The first version was published and available in the Jenkins Plugin
Registry since April 2018 and has been used so far by hundreds of
developers around the world that provided already very useful feedback
and started contributing with pull-requests.

### v0.3.7 - Released - 3 December 2019

#### Highlights

Significant performance improvment on the branch indexing and checkout
of changes. On the validation of [Gerrit Code Review CI](https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com) the
branch indexing time was reduced from **40 minutes down to 2 minutes** (20x performance improvement).

Also, introduces the ability to reduce the number of refs being fetched by defining a custom
query condition.

#### New features

- Provide GERRIT_REFNAME environment variable
- Improve performance by fetching only the individual change ref instead of the full refs/changes/*
- Avoid fetching patch-sets multiple times when not strictly needed
- Allow configuration of an extra filter for open changes (default to -age:24w)

Improvement of the compliance of the plugin with the rest of the
ecosystem of Jenkinsfile steps.

the deprecation of the old DSL-based integration, which was not
compatible with the way plugins should be written and integrated with
the rest of the CPS scripts and pipelines.

# Future RoadMap

See below the roadmap I have envisaged for this plugin. However, I do
follow a fully Agile approach where it is really the user that drives
the development of the product, rather than a project plan.

The roadmap below can then change based on what are your needs and the
adoption by the community.


### v1.0 - Planned

##### Highlights

First fully functional release of the Gerrit Code Review integration
that can be functionally equivalent to the historical Gerrit Trigger
Plugin but with a focus on Jenkinsfile pipelines.

### v0.7 - Planned

##### Highlights

Support for internal networks where any calls outside the Jenkins node
can be made via Proxy servers.

### v0.6 - Planned

##### Highlights

Support for builds against Gerrit replicas, where API for review
feedback can be different from the one used for fetching the changes.

The challenge of this release is how to automatically discover the
upstream Gerrit node purely based on the fetch URL.

### v0.5 - Planned

##### Highlights

Introduction of the Git/SSH protocol support and use for review
feedback.

### v0.4 - Planned

##### Highlights

Support for BlueOcean, including change description, hyperlink and owner
visible from Jenkins UI.
